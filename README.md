# Boston Housing Price Prediction - mlops-assignment-1

In this project, I designed and implemented a complete MLOps workflow to predict Boston Housing Prices using classical machine learning models.
The goal was to automate the model training and evaluation process using Github actions while maintaining a modular and reusable code structure.

Two regression models were used:
1. DecisionTreeRegressor & 2.KernelRidge

All key functions for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation are defined in misc.py
